# ThomsonSolve
A Haskell Based Generalised Thomson Problem Solver (High Lower Bound)


## What does this do?
Currently, this program iteratively spaces 'k' points inside a unit n-ball optimally using an approximated Riesz s-energy method.

## What will this project do in the future?
This program hopes to use the cartesian product of 2-balls to gain a space advantage and be able to place more points inside the volume.
A small modification that I will make soon is to place the points on the (n-1)-sphere.


## FAQs
### Why was this even made?
This project was made to explore space-optimal structures for high dimensional communications - if you want more details you can have a look at my blog when the project is live.

### Why did you write this in Haskell?
I was in the Haskell folder on my computer and I was too lazy to move to the python folder to start this project.
I was also rusty in my Haskell and I needed the practise.
